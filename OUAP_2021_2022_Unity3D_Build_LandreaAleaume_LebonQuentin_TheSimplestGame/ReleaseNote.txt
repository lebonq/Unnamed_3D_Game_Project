Project : THE SIMPLEST GAME

------------------------------------------HOW TO USE--------------------------------------------

First person vision.
Arrows to move the avatar.
Right-click to fire bullets.

Avoid / kill monsters and survive for as long as possible.
The timer is in the upper-left corner.
Last until the end and win.

------------------------------LIST OF GENERATED OBJECTS----------------------------------

- Terrain : it’s an empty object. During the scene loading, the terrain is generated. We use a set of Perlin Noise with different amplitudes and frequencies to generate mountains, plains and hills. Texture changes with height and the angle of the slope (We use a custom shader). Then we add trees and monsters.

- Tree trunk : prefabricated object. Part of a tree. used to create tree trunks and tree branches. placed at random distances from the previous tree trunk in the same tree, but always up and close to the previous object, and always in the same direction for parts of branches. Trees have a limited number of trunk objects for the trunk of the tree and each branch. 20% chance for each tree trunk object to start a branch.

- Tree leaves : prefabricated object. Part of a tree. Placed when all tree trunk objects of the same series have been placed.

- Player : the avatar for the player. Using a simple capsule, sphere, cylinder, and a camera. Moves and interacts with the world using a RigidBody. Can fire bullets. Has a boolean that says when he is dead, launching the Game Over sequence.

- Bullet : prefabricated object. A simple sphere. Erases monsters on collision. Lasts for 10 seconds after creation. It collides with terrain and obeys the law of physics.

- Monster : prefabricated instances. Generated at random for every instance. Limited number of instances are created upon starting the game. Destroyed on collision with Bullets. Kill the Player on collision. Emit sound.

- Canvas, Texts, and others : used for Menu windows, and printing the Time in the HUD of the player. 



----------------------------------------------Limitation -----------------------------------------------------

-The map is not infinite.
-There is no jump function.
-Player speed can’t be altered.
-Can’t switch between first and third person PoV.
-Monsters are all the same color.
-Trees are all the same color.
-No score system depending on monsters killed.

----------------------------------------------Know bugs-----------------------------------------------------

-Sometimes the player falls inside the ground for apparently no reasons.
-The Hitbox of monsters doesn’t fit the mesh (because it was apparently impossible to add a Rigidbody directly to the mesh of our monsters since it isn't a normal mesh.
-Gravity doesn’t affect entities while they are moving.
-Shadows go inside textures and can be seen from behind the ground.
-Due to how entities are placed, it is possible for a tree to be superposed with the player, a monster to be superposed with the player, or a monster to be superposed with a tree.
-Snow is supposed to be created at a specific height of the Terrain. It was at some point. It isn’t now. No known reason why.

----------------------------------------------Ways to improve--------------------------------------------

-Add HUD with number of monster kill
-Better software architecture with an event based one
-Better AI
-Better generation of terrain and trees
-Better Monster
-Fix the shadows that can be seen from underground.
-Health system for the player (and the monsters)
-Add a “run” button to go faster.
-Add more tree and monster textures.
-Add a second camera for third person PoV.
-Allow to quit the game in advance, while remembering progress.
-Allow to change to survival time (currently 120 seconds).
-Create a “wave” mode where the player has no time limit, but more and more monsters are generated every few seconds, lasting until death.
-Put in place a score system.
